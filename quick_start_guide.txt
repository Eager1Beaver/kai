$$$ time derivative of signal intensity, durations at certain $$$

Inside the program's folder you may find a subfolder named "sample".
It contains 3 files:
1) "sample_raw_signal_data.xlsx" - an input file containing raw signal data;
2) "sample_ambient_signal_data.xlsx" - an input file containing ambient signal data;
3) "sample_output_signal_data.xlsx" - an output file containing processed signal data.
You may use them for a test-run.

****************************

--- Global parameters --- 
1) Pacing frequency (Hz) --- a frequency of a stimulator used to stimulate cells (typically, 0.5Hz, 1Hz, 2Hz). By default it is set to 1 Hz.
2) OY transposition --- an OY starting point of a processed signal. It is automatically defined by the program during processing. Ultumately, a starting point of all signal periods after processing is (0.0, 0.0).
3) Verbose --- detalization of output info:
	0 --- silent
	1 --- major plots and messages (by default)
	2 --- all plots and messages


--- Set global parameters --- 
Pres this button to pass (pre-defined) values of the global parameters to the program.
You can type the values manually or pass the default values just by pressing this button.


--- Select input file path --- 
Press this button to choose a file which contains a recording of raw signal data.
You can select an .XLSX file as well as a .CSV file. 
If you select an .XLSX file, make sure that an excel sheet with your signal data is named "data".
Also make sure that a decimal separator of numeric data is a point (i.e. "121.4", not "121,4").
By convention, a column containing time-data should be named "t' and a column containing intensity-data should be named "i".


--- Select input file path of an ambient signal (optional) --- 
Press this button to choose a file wich contains ambient signal data (with no stimulation) if such data is available.
If such data is provided, it will be substracted from signal data.
You can select an .XLSX file as well as a .CSV file. 
If you select an .XLSX file, make sure that an excel sheet with your signal data is named "data".
Also make sure that a decimal separator of numeric data is a point (i.e. "121.4", not "121,4").
By convention, a column containing time-data should be named "t' and a column containing intensity-data should be named "i".


--- Select output file path --- 
Press this button to choose a path of an output file.
You do not need to specify the output file extension.
The output file will be an .XLSX file with 3 sheets.
Sheet 1: output_processed_signal --- it contains processed signal data.
Sheet 2: output_angles --- it contains a value of a maximal time derivative (=tangent, + a corresponding angle) of a processed signal (periods + an averaged period). 
Sheet 3: output_durations --- it contains values of the durations (at 20%, 50% and 90% of signal's peak) of the processed signal (periods + an averaged period). 


--- Start --- 
Press this button to start signal processing.


--- Abort the processing --- 
Press this button if you want to interrupt the signal processing.
If pressed, all windows except the main program window will be closed right after a current processing stage has been completed.
Then, if needed, you will be able to change the input parameters, input and output file paths and press the "Start" button again to start signal processing from the beginning.


--- Exit --- 
Press this button to close the program.
All windows will be immediately closed.
The button can be pressed anytime.

****** II. Filters Utility window ******
****************************************
****************************************


--- Choose filters parameters ---
The program implements 3 signal filters: Gaussian, Lowpass and Savgol. You can set a Mode for each filter. There are 3 Modes. Mode 1 represents a lower level of smoothness. Mode 3 represents a higher level of smoothness. Mode 2 represents an average level of smoothness.
All 3 filters can be combined. The "Combined filter" represents a combination of those 3 filters.


--- Plot baseline and filtered signals ---
Press this button to juxtapose a non-filtered signal with a filtered signal.
When pressed, you will see 4 plots representing a behavior of 4 different filters.
Use this button to observe effects of different Modes and to choose the most optimal Filter-Mode combination for a given signal.


--- Set one filter ---
Press this button to choose 1 of 4 filters which will be used in futher calculations.
A Mode of the chosen filter is set by a user in the "Choose filters parameters" section.


--- Set a filter using a specified mode ---
Press this button to pass information about a chosen Filter-Mode combination to the program for further calculations.
Choose a desired filter in the "Set one filter" section.
Choose a desired Mode in the "Choose filters parameters" section.


--- Exit (return to the main program) ---
Once a filter is set, you may close the Filters Utility window by pressing this button.

****** III. Periods to remove window ******
*******************************************
*******************************************


Numbers of all FULL periods are displayed on this window. 
Click on a checkbox to choose which period will be removed. 
If you do not want to remove any periods, press the "Set periods to be removed" button anyway. You will immediately see a message: "No periods will be removed".


--- Set periods to be removed ---
Press this button to pass information about periods which will be removed to the program. If you do not click on any checkboxes, neither of the periods will be removed.


--- Exit ---
Press this button to close the "Periods to remove" window and return to the Main program.
Make sure to close all plots and figures before closing this window.
